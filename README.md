# OpenPermissions

OpenPermissions is an open-source library and utility for smoothly, efficiently and easily managing permissions in your GLua addons.

## Installation

Simply download from GitHub and install into your addons folder like usual.

Note: GmodAdminSuite comes with OpenPermissions, so you don't need to install OpenPermissions if you already have GmodAdminSuite.

## Usage

To open the OpenPermissions menu, type `!openpermissions` in chat, or type `openpermissions` in your game's console.

You can only access the menu if you have permission to, read below for more information.

## Configuration

OpenPermissions has very minimal configuration, and is configured using an addon which can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/GmodAdminSuite/OpenPermissions-Config).
