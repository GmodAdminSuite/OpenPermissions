# OpenPermissions

OpenPermissions is an open-source library and utility for smoothly, efficiently and easily managing permissions in your GLua addons.

## Installation

It is not recommended that you install OpenPermissions from its source code.

Instead, you should add the [OpenPermissions Workshop addon](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1595317397) to your server's [Workshop collection](http://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Workshop_for_Dedicated_Servers).

## Usage

To open the OpenPermissions menu, type `!openpermissions` in chat, or type `openpermissions` in your game's console.

You can only access the menu if you have permission to, read below for more information.

## Configuration

OpenPermissions has very minimal configuration, and is configured using an addon which can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/GmodAdminSuite/OpenPermissions-Config).
